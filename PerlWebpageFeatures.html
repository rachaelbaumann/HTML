        <h2>Features of Perl</h2>
        <span>
            <!-- Perl is an interpreted, high-level, dynamic programming Language. Perl has several backronyms, including
            Practical Extraction and Reporting Language. Perl was created by Larry Wall in 1987 as a Unix scriptin language
            to make report processing easier. Perl borrows from C, shell script, AWK, and sed. -->
            The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C, shell script (sh), 
            AWK, and sed; Wall also alludes to Basic and Lisp in the introduction to Learning Perl 
            (Schwartz & Christiansen) and so on. They provide text processing facilities without the 
            arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix commandline tools, facilitating manipulation 
            of text files. Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part 
            due to its then unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities.

        <br/>
            In addition to CGI, Perl 5 is used for system administration, network programming, finance, 
            bioinformatics, and other applications, such as for GUIs. It has been nicknamed "the Swiss Army chainsaw 
            of scripting languages" because of its flexibility and power, and also its ugliness. In 1998, it was 
            also referred to as the "duct tape that holds the Internet together," in reference to both its ubiquitous 
            use as a glue language and its perceived inelegance.

    <h1>Perl Programming Language</h1>
    <span>
        Perl was invented by Larry Wall in 1967, it was used as a text processing language.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Perl is supposedly an easy language to learn. It looks like most programming languages you're likely to
        have experience with, so if you've ever written an C program, an awk script, a shell script, or even 
        BASIC program, you're already part way there.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Perl is an interpreted language. This means that you can write your programs and test them 
        without an intermediate compilation step, allowing you to experiment and test/debug quickly and easily. 
        This ease of experimentation flattens the learning curve even more.
        <br/>
        <br/>

        You can download Perl, learn how to get started, view the documentation, and other things on their site.

                <h4>About Perl</h4>
                Perl 5 is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over 30 years of development. 
                Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from portables to mainframes and is suitable for both rapid 
                prototyping and large scale development projects.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                "Perl" is a family of languages, "Perl 6" is part of the family, but it is a separate language which
                 has its own development team. Its existence has no significant impact on the continuing development of 
                 "Perl 5".
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 <h4>About Larry Wall</h4>
                 Larry Wall grew up in Los Angeles and then Bremerton, Washington, before starting higher education at Seattle 
                 Pacific University in 1976, majoring in chemistry and music and later pre-medicine with a hiatus of 
                 several years working in the university's computing center before graduating with a bachelor's degree 
                 in Natural and Artificial Languages.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                While in graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, Wall and his wife were studying 
                linguistics with the intention of finding an unwritten language, perhaps in Africa, and creating a 
                writing system for it. They would then use this new writing system to translate various texts into the 
                language, among them the Bible.[3] Due to health reasons these plans were cancelled, and they remained 
                in the United States, where Wall, instead joined the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory after he finished 
                graduate school.

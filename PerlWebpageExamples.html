        <h2>Examples of Perl</h2>
        <span>
            Perl was originally used for text manipulation. Now it has several uses, such as system administration, 
            web development, netwoek programming, and GUI development. Here is an example of how to create the
            <a href = "http://www.perltutorial.org/developing-the-first-perl-program/">'Hello, World' application</a>
            in Perl.

            <a href = "https://www.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a> 
            is dedicated to the advancement of the Perl programming language through open discussion, 
            collaboration, design, and code. It coordinates the efforts of numerous grass-roots Perl-based groups, including:
            International Yet Another Perl Conferences; Carries the legal responsibility for Perl 5 and Perl 6; perl.org;
            Perl Mongers; PerlMonks.

            The overall structure of Perl derives broadly from C. Perl is procedural in nature, with variables, 
            expressions, assignment statements, brace-delimited blocks, control structures, and subroutines.
            The design of Perl can be understood as a response to three broad trends in the computer industry: 
            falling hardware costs, rising labor costs, and improvements in compiler technology. Many earlier 
            computer languages, such as Fortran and C, aimed to make efficient use of expensive computer hardware. 
            In contrast, Perl was designed so that computer programmers could write programs more quickly and easily.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Perl has chiefly been used to write CGI scripts: large projects written in Perl include cPanel, Slash, 
            Bugzilla, RT, TWiki, and Movable Type; high-traffic websites that use Perl extensively include Priceline.com, 
            Craigslist, IMDb, LiveJournal, DuckDuckGo, Slashdot and Ticketmaster. It is also an optional 
            component of the popular LAMP technology stack for Web development, in lieu of PHP or Python.

            Here's a sample of Perl code. It's not cute. Perl has a reputation of being really ugly.
